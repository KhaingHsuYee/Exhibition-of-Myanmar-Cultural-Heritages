                <p>
                    Yangon is often the first stop for foreigners visiting Myanmar.It is the former capital,the most populous city,and the largest 
                    commercial hub in the country.It's also the spiritual heart of Myanmar,being home to the Shwedagon Pagoda,regarded as the most 
                    sacred Buddhist pagoda among Burmese.Yangon has plenty to offer whether you're planning to hit the expat pubs,sample a traditional 
                    Burmese meal or wander the streets admiring the colonial architecture.Shop for precious gems,antiques,art and traditional handicrafts
                    at the Bogyoke Market,a major tourist destination in the heart of the city.The Sule Pagoda,right smack on a busy intersection in the 
                    city,is home to shrines containing eight Buddha images.For some old-warm charm,enjoy high tea at the iconic Strand Hotel,opened in 1901.

                        It's said that you haven't really been to Yangon unless you visit the world famous Shwedagon Pagoda.The golden pagoda,built 
                        more than 2,600 years ago,is the most famous temple in Myanmar.It has four main stairway entrances with each one leading you 
                        to the pagoda's platform.When you reach the upper level,you breath will be taken away and you will feel absolutely peaceful.
                        Early in the morning or in the evening at around 6pm are the perfect times to visit.Please note that revealing clothes are 
                        prohibited and that shoes aren't allowed to be worn in the pagoda area.

                        The Sule pagoda is not only a religious and historical pagoda landmark in Yangon,but it's also a city navigational landmark 
                        as well;It seems that all roads in downtown Yangon eventually lead to the Sule Pagoda.The area is also home to numerous government 
                        buildings and offices,and a center for bus and road transportation.The Sule pagoda is not only recognized and cherished for its 
                        long history,but in the more recent history of Myanmar,the pagoda has served as a strategic space for politics,rallies,and protests.

                    The Botahtaung Pagoda is a famous pagoda located in downtown Yangon,Myanmar,near the Yangon river. The pagoda was first 
                    built by the Mon around the same time as was Shwedagon Pagoda-according to local belief,over 2500 years ago,and was known 
                    as Kyaik-de-att in Mon language.The pagoda is hollowed within,and houses what is believed to be a sacred hair of Gautama 
                    Buddha.

                    The 120-year-old Ministers' Office,also known as the Secretariat Building,is one of the most iconic buildings in Yangon.This 
                    historic building sits in the middle of the city and it is the place where General Aung San and another six cabinet ministers 
                    were assassinated on July 19,1947.The Secretariat Buildings has been closed for several years and is currently undergoning 
                    renovations although members of the public can still take a one-hour guided tour,from Monday to Friday.

                        nuclear war.He also helped end a civil war in the Congo.He and his family lived in the two-story colonial-style house from 
                        1951-57 when he was secretary to then Burmese Prime Minster U Nu,before leaving the country to serve as Burma's Permanent 
                        Representative to the UN in New York in 1957.The home now stands as a beautifully restored place where you can learn more about U Thant and buy the books written by

                        Mandalay,Meiktila and Bahmaw.The cemetery is located in Mingaladon Township,Pyay,Road in Yangon and can be reached by bus or

                        We pictured Bogyoke Market being more like a food and home products market,but actually,this market focuses on textiles,

                        vendors selling traditional Burmese clothing and 'backpacker' clothing.If you want to come home with souvenirs,this is easily

                        The downtown area of Yangon is chaotic,hectic,and there never seems to be a quiet or dull moment.That's quite the exaxt 
                        opposite to take when you visit Kandawgyi Park.On the east side of the park,there are a number of restaurants,including the 
                        Karaweik Palace,but also a few other lake-side relaxing restaurants where you can eat and have a drink.Visiting Kandawgyi 
                        Park is one of the greatest things to do in Yangon because it's such a change of pace and a heaven of caim in the usually 
                        buzzing downtown of Yangon.
