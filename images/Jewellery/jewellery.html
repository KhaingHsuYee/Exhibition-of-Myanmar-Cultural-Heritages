    <h2>Jade</h2>

    Myanmar produces approximately 70 percent of the world's supply for high-quality jadeitd. Most of the Myanmar's jadeite is exported to other nations,primarily Asian, for use in jewelry,art and ornaments.

     are graded into classes based on colour, brightness and clarity.</p>

    Both white and golden pearls are produced by local water inhabitants, the Pinctada maxima oyster. The gold lipped oysters produce the golden colored pearls while the silver lipped ones produce shite and silver pearls. Pearls are sold loose in lots or parcels,and also as finished ornaments. </p>
