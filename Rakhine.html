                            Kyauktaw Mahamuni Buddha Image is a Buddhist temple and major pilgrimage site, located southwest of Mandalay,
                             Myanmar (Burma).The Mahamuni Image (lit. 'The Great Sage') is enshrined in this temple, and originally came from 
                             Arakan.It is highly venerated in Burma and central to many people's lives, as it is seen as an expression of 
                             representing the Buddha's life.Ancient tradition refers to only five likenesses of the Buddha made during his 
                             lifetime; two were in India, two in paradise, and the fifth is the Mahamuni Image in Myanmar.Legend holds that the
                              Buddha himself visited the Dhanyawadi city of Arakan in 554 BC.King Sanda Thuriya requested that an image be cast 
                              of him. Once complete, the Buddha breathed upon it, and thereafter the image took on his exact likeness.

                            Koe-Thaung translates to “shrine of the 90,000 images of the Buddha”, referring to the number of Buddha images 
                            that it contained. The temple was built in 1553 to gain religious merit by King Min Dikkha, the son of Min Bin 
                            who built the Shite-Thaung (“temple of the 80,000 images of the Buddha”) three decades earlier.After being 
                            abandoned centuries earlier, excavation works started in 1996 and the Koe-Thaung was partly restored. During 
                            excavation works several items were found like stone oil lamps, that were used to illuminate the dark interior
                             of the temple.The massive Koe-Thaung temple is built of stone walls and stone terraces and has a maze like 
                             interior. Its entrance is on the East side. The temple is surrounded by five receding terraces on which a 
                             large number of small stupas stand. At the center of the Koe-Thaung is a large circular bell shaped stupa.

                                Viewpoint, popularly known as Point, is the principal attraction in Sittwe, the capital of Arakan State,
                                Myanmar (also known as Burma). It is an urban park which serves mainly as a viewing deck into the Indian 
                                Ocean and the nearby scenery.It is the southernmost tip of the city and looks out onto where the Bay of 
                                Bengal and the mouth of the Kaladan River meet. It is built on a rock jutting out into the Indian Ocean,
                                with the ocean to the west and the river on the east. The Point consists of the main deck, an old look-out
                                tower, a modern lighthouse, a few statues of Rakhine cultural aspects, including a Rakhine mythical creature, 
                                Byala (known as Nawa Rupa in Burmese), and a scene of two wrestlers competing in Kyin wrestling, the traditional
                                wrestling of the Rakhine people, and part of the Sittwe Beach. The two main roads of Sittwe, the Old Strand and 
                                the New Strand Roads, converge at the entrance to Point.

                            Ngapali (pronounced Napally and said to be named after the Italian city of Naples) is Myanmar’s premier 
                            beach destination. Located on the Bay of Bengal coast in Rakhine State, its main feature is an idyllic stretch 
                            of white sand and palm tree-lined coast, with a number of resorts spread out next to traditional fishing 
                            villages.There are also some new hotel developments on the beaches nearer the airport (which is named Thandwe
                            after the nearby inland town, but is in fact located closer to Ngapali – about six kilometres north of the 
                            main beach).
