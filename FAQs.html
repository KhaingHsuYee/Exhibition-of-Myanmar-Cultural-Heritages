                                <strong>A:</strong> You should plan to spend around MMK92,746 ($44) per day on your vacation in Myanmar, which is the average daily price based on the expenses of other visitors. Past travelers have spent, on average, MMK13,772 ($6.56) on meals for one day and MMK5,663 ($2.70) on local transportation. Also, the average hotel price in Myanmar for a couple is MMK39,899 ($19). So, a trip to Myanmar for two people for one week costs on average MMK1,298,448 ($618). All of these average travel prices have been collected from other travelers to help you plan your own travel budget.

                        <div class="panel">
                        <p>
                            <strong>A:</strong> Most of Myanmar has a tropical monsoon climate with three seasons:
                            <br><br>
                            Cool &dash; November to February is warm to hot during the day and the air is relatively dry. <br>
                            Hot &dash; March to May is intensely hot in most of the country.
                            In the cool and hot seasons, you are unlikely to experience any rain. <br>
                            Rainy &dash; June to October is the monsoon season, with high rainfall. From June to August, rainfall can be constant for long periods of time, particularly on the Bay of Bengal coast and in Yangon and the Irrawaddy Delta. In September and October, the rain is less intense and you will experience more sunshine.
                            <br><br>
                            The most comfortable time to visit is during the cool season, which is also the least humid time of year and has the clearest air &dash; however, this is also the peak tourist season. If you can put up with the heat and/or rain, then you will find it easier (and often cheaper) to book accommodation outside the cool season, and there will be less crowds at popular destinations.

                        <div class="panel">
                        <p>
                            <strong>A:</strong> Myanmar is known as "The Golden Land" because of the abundant use of gold leaf on its temples and shrines. You will see many golden Buddhist pagodas in Myanmar. So also expressed as "No Village with No Pagoda"
                        </p>

                        <div class="panel">
                        <p>
                            <strong>A:</strong> the people of Myanmar have retained a genuine and warm sense of hospitality.
                            You will find that most Burmese people are friendly, helpful and willing to share their lifestyle with foreign visitors. Their sincere hospitality is one of the reasons why Myanmar will continue to attract visitors in future.
                            <br>
                            Besides,Our drivers are equally willing to please. For example, when you return after visiting attractions, their air-conditioned cars are always cooled down and ready to welcome you. Drivers will supply you with water and tissues, help you with luggage, and more.
        
                            Waiters and waitresses in the restaurants and hotels are also very helpful.

                        <p>
                            <strong>A:</strong> <ul>
                                <li>
                                    <i>Respect the local religious customs.</i> More than 80 percent of the Burmese population is Buddhist1, and while they will not impose their beliefs on visitors, they will expect you to pay due respect to their traditional practices. Wear appropriate clothes when visiting religious sites, and don't violate their space: avoid touching a monk's robes, and don't disturb praying or meditating people in temples.
                                </li>
                                <li>
                                    <i>What not to wear:</i> For appropriate clothing in temples and other important tips, read about <a href="https://www.tripsavvy.com/visiting-buddhist-temples-dos-and-donts-1629907">Do's and Don'ts for Buddhist Temples</a>.
                                </li>
                                <li>
                                    <i>Mind your body language.</i> The Burmese, like their religious compatriots around Southeast Asia, have strong feelings about the head and feet. The head is considered holy, while the feet are considered impure. So keep your hands off people's heads; touching other people's heads is considered the height of disrespect2, something to avoid doing even to children.
                                </li>
                                <li>
                                    <i>Watch what you do with your feet, too.</i> You shouldn't point to or touch objects with them, and you should tuck them under yourself when sitting on the ground or floor. Don't sit with your feet pointing away from your body—or worse—pointing at a person or a pagoda.
                                    
                                </li>
                                <li>
                                    <i>Don’t show affection in public.</i> Myanmar is still a conservative country, and the locals may be       offended by public displays of affection. So when traveling with a loved one, no hugs and kisses in public, please!
                                </li>
                                <li>
                                    <i>Don't disrespect the Buddha.</i> This is the most important !!! Myanmar people are so religious.
                                    So,don't respect the Buddha images or even the picture of Buddha in postcard even if you are not Buddhist. People will get angry if you do so.
                                </li>
                            </ul>
