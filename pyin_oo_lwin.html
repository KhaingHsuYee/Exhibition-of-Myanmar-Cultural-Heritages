                    carriages.owever,the buildings are not like the colonial buildings of Yangon and Mandalay.They are cute brick structures 
                    that will surely win your heart.Pyin Oo Lwin is home to the historic National Kandawgyi Botanical Gardens,the country's 
                    largest Botanical site established in 1915.This garden contains 514 species of indigenous trees and 74 foreign species,as 
                    well as 300 types of orchids and 25 different roses.The garden have been modelled after the famous Kew Gardens of London.The 
                    best way to enjoy Pyin Oo Lwin is to simply take a walk and immerse yourself in the hilly atmosphere.</p>

                                The building of this Pagoda has a history of its own. The reason was that three marble Buddha Images sculpted 
                                in Mandalay were being transported to their planned destination in China. On this journey, one of the Buddha 
                                statues fell down from the truck and could not be reloaded due to its weight. After many attempts, this Image 
                                was left behind and the other two were taken on their way. A local Buddhist monk decided he would try faith. 
                                He sat for 7 days on this image and preached to the locals and recited teachings of Buddha. After 7 days the 
                                image was apparently easily lifted and placed in its current location and the local people built a pagoda as 
                                an offering to Buddha.

                                The National Kandawgyi Gardens (formerly National Botanical Gardens) is located in the Alpine town about
                                 1.5 km south of Pyin Oo Lwin (formerly Maymyo), Myanmar. It was first founded by Alex Roger, a forest research
                                  officer, with the aid of Lady Cuffe, the botanist in 1915. It was modelled after the Kew Gardens of England.
                                   The original area of the Botanical Garden was 170 acres of land and 70 acres of water spread totaling 240 
                                   acres. The government declared as a state-regonized garden in 1917. In 1924, the site was declared as 
                                   a Goverment Forest Reserve. The garden has many collection of flora, including foreign species, orchids
                                    of various species in orchid garden, dahlia gardens, rose gardens, many exotic fruits and shady trees.
                                     In 2000, the garden was upgraded to be a recreation garden and renamed it “Kandawgyi National Gardens”.

                                behind the making of the tower,it still rings the tune of Big Ben and plays 16 notes before the hour,making the visit even

                                Pyin Oo Lwin,which is quite unlike the grand colonial edifices found in Yangon or Mandalay.It's almost like stepping into 19th century England.

                                to get the original form and  the real atmosphere of the original building for everyone who look this house.If you do one day trip to 
                                Pyinoolwin from Mandalay , you definitely have to go to this place.But you need to pay entrance fee 2 USD per person if you like to go 
                                inside the building and it is still worth to visit.
