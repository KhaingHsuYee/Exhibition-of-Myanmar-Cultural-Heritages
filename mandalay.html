                <p>
                    Mandalay is the second-largest city in Myanmar,after Yangon.Mandalay was founded in 1857 by King Mindon,replacing Amarapura
                    as the new royal capital of the Konbaung dynasty.It was Burma's final royal capital before the kingdom's annexation by the 
                    British Empire in 1885.Under British rule,Mandalay remained commercially and culturally important despite the rise of 
                    Yangon,the new capital of British Burma.The city suffered extensive destruction during the Japanese conquest of Burma in the 
                    Second World War.In 1948,Mandalay became part of the newly independent Union of Burma.Today,Mandalay is the economic centre of 
                    Upper Myanmar and considered the centre of Burmese culture.A continuing influx of illegal Chinese immigrants,mostly from 
                    Yunnan,since the late 20th century,has reshaped the city's ethnic makeup and increased commerce with China.Despite Naypyidaw's 
                    recent rise,Mandalay remains Upper Burma's main commercial,education and health center.It is also an important religious centre 
                    of the country,housing around 700 Buddhist pagodas.

                    <p>
                        The Mandalay Palace,located in Mandalay,Myanmar,is the last rotal palace of the last Burmese monarchy.The palace was 
                        constructed between 1857 and 1859 as part of King Mindon's founding of the new royal capital city of Mandalay.The plan 
                        of Mandalay Palace largely follows the traditional Burmese palace design-it is indide a walled fort surrounded by a moat.
                        Mandalay Palace was the primary royal residence of King Mindon and King Thibaw,the last two kings of the country.Much of 
                        the palace compound was destroyed during World War 2 by allied bombing;only the royal mint and the watch tower survived.
                        A replica of the palace was rebuilt in the 1990s with some modern materials.Today,Mandalay Palace is a primary symbol of 
                        Mandalay and a major tourist destination.

                    <p>
                        Mandalay Hill is a 240 metres hill that is located to the northeast of the city centre of Mandalay in Myanmar.The city 
                        took its name from the hill.Mandalay Hill is known for its abundance of pagodas and monasteries,and has been a major 
                        pilgrimages site for Burmese Buddhists for nearly two centuries.At the top of the hill is the Sutaungpyei(literally wish-
                        fulfilling)Pagoda.A panoramic view of Mandalay Hill alone makes it worhwhile to attempt a climb up its stairways.There are 
                        four covered stairways called saungdan leading up the hill from the south,southeast,west and noth,and convenient seats of 
                        masonry work line these stairways all the way up.A one-way motor road today saves time and also makes it accessible for 
                        those who are unable to climb up the stairs,leading to an escalator and a lift to the pagoda at the summit.

                  <p>
                    U Bein Bridge is a crossing that spans the Taungthaman Lake near Amarapura in Myanmar.The 1.2 kilometre bridge was 
                    built around 1850 and is believed to be the oldest and longest teakwood bridge in the world.Construction on the wooden 
                    bridge was completed in 1851 after three years.The bridge was built at a slight curve,and is supported by over a thousand
                    wooden pillars that were hammered into the bottom of the shallow lake.The planks of teak that make up the surface of the 
                    bridge were taken from the old royal of Inwa,a former Burmese capital,that had been razed a number of times.The resulting 
                    bridge might not look royal,but it is history certainly is.U Bein is one of the most popular attractions in Mandalay for tourists who come here to witness the magical sunset over the bridge.

                    The Shwenandaw known as Golden Palace Monastery has its unique and magnificent beauty,formed by teak carvings depicting tales 
                    from Buddhist mythology in all of its roof and walls.The monastery was formerly a royal apartment built by King Mindon.After 
                    his death in 1878,King Thibaw(the son of King Mindon)moved the palace to the current locations as he thought that the ghost of 
                    his father still existed in there.In the year 1883,it transformed into monastery until now.An impressive point of this monastery 
                    is that the whole monastery is built entirely by teak wood.Take relaxation and walk around monastery while watching the exceptional 
                    architectural sculptures and carvings.Note:it is rank as Number 1 place to visit in Mandalay.

                        The Kuthodaw pagoda in Mandalay comprises of a glided pagoda,hundreds of shrines housing inscribed marble slabs and 
                        several pavilions.The pagoda is also called "the world's largest book",named after the 729 marble slabs inscribed with 
                        Buddhist teachings.In Burmese known as the Maha Lawka Marazein Paya,the Kuthodaw is located at the foot of Mandalay Hill.
                        The large grounds offer good views upwards of Mandalay Hill with its many temples and pagodas.The Kuthodaw pagoda was built 
                        by King Mindon Min at the same time the nearby Toyal Palace was built.Construction started shortly after the founding of 
                        Mandalay in 1857.The King built the Kuthodaw to leave a great work of merit for future generations.

                        Mahamuni Buddha Temple is on of the major pilgrimages located in the southwest of Mandalay.Inside the temple,there is a big 
                        Buddha statue called Mahamuni Buddha image.Some say that its origin is from Arakan brought as the but as the legendary stated 
                        that the image is one of the likenesses of Buddha,made at the time of Buddha alive;two images were in paradise,and two were
                        in India.Though it is a busy spot to visit,you should not skip this place as it provides you a range of authenticity of 
                        middle Myanmar.Before you exit,shop around the markets for souvenirs.If you are an early bird,you can see the daily format

                        Places we mentioned above were mostly built with woods because of a bountiful supply of wood that time.Unlike other forms 
                        of the monastery,Maha Aung Mye Bon Zan Monastery was built of brick and stucco.The usual name of this monastery is Mal Nu 
                        Oak Monastery-in that,"Mal Nu" was the Queen who built this monastery and "Oak" means brick.It is remarked as the impressive 
                        architecture of Konbaung dynasty.It is a well-preserved and long-standing building though it endures the effect of climate 
                        and human activities since 1818.The 1838 earthquake hit most of the vital building including this monastery.If truth to be 
                        told,it was renovated four decades later the earthquake.

                        Kyauktawgyi Paya dates from the 19th century and its biggest claim to fame is the 900 ton statue of the Buddha that is housed 
                        inside and is 26 feet tall.The Buddha is also unusual as it is clothed in a royal costume and it was also carved from a single 
                        block of smooth marble.According to legend,it took 10,000 workers some 13 days to hoist the marble from a neighboring canal and 
                        the site was dedicated in 1865.Make sure not to miss the outer walls which are covered in mirrored tiles and the little shrines 
                        in the other courtyards which have alms bowls and pictures of King Mindon who visited in 1865.

                        (dealers)because the main trades take places at that time.However,this is not a tourist attraction site,it is usually crowded 
                        with tourists and local visitors.Yet there are many stalls to explore,please be careful about different pricing and different 
                        quality if you buy an expensive thing.
