                    Shan State has been quoted by many a famous traveller as the land of picture postard settings.Occupying close to a quarter of 
                    Myanmar's land mass,it is often hard to find words to do justice to its beautiful scenery.Shan state is lost in the mists of 
                    time,shrouded in mystique,intrigue and adventure.The infamous Golden Triangle,the Leg Rowers of Inle Lake,the Floating Markets 
                    and Gardens,the Long Necked Women,the Shan shoulder bag and the Nation's national dress,the 'longyi' woven by indigenous looms;
                    all are part of what makes Shan State a must for the traveller who wishes to see the real Myanmar.
