                <p>
                    There are two preeminent ancient religious cities in Southeast Asia:Bagan in Burma and Angkor in Cambodia.Both sites are notable for their expanse of sacred geography and the number and size of their individual temples.For many visitors, Bagan is the more extraordinary because of its wonderful views.This temple is one of Myanmar's main attractions.Bagan that is commonly termed as a sea of temples by people across the world is an ancient city and a UNESCO World Heritage Site in the Mandalay Region of Myanmar.From the 9th to 13th centuries,the city was the capital of the Bagan Kingdom,the first kingdom the unified the regions that would later consitute Myanmar.During the kingdom's height between the 11th and 13th centuries, more than 10,000 Buddhist temples,pagodas and monasteries were constructed in the Bagan plains alone,of which the remains of over 2200 temples and pagodas survive.These temples and pagodas annually attracts thousands of tourist to visit.The best time to visit Bagan is from November to May when there is little rainfall in the ares.
                    These are our favorite local haunts,touristy spots,and hidden gems throughout Bagan.

                  <p>
                    This history of Thatbyinnyu Temple can be dated back to the 12th century during the reign of King Alaungsithu.It 
                    is located in Bagan and is one of the top places to see in Myanmar.A vacation to this place with family definitely 
                    calls for a visit to Thatbyinnyu Temple.The temple is shaped in an asymmetrical cross and has two storeys,one of which 
                    bears the image of Buddha.

                  <p>
                    Among the most beautiful places to visit in Myanmar,the Ananda Temple amazes the visitors through its marvelous single- 
                    storey architecture and peaceful ambiance.The temple's most fascinating feature is its gilded Shikhara,a towering spire
                    on top of the pagoda,which can be witnessed from miles away over the Bagan plains.The illuminated Ananda Pagoda at night 
                    creates a mystical appeal and is indeed a sight to behold and capture.The pagoda was damaged during the 1975 earthquake 
                    but restored after extensive renovations.A favorite among visitors.It shows clear signs of Mon architecture mixed with a 
                    bit of North Indian style.It is also known for Ananda Pagoda Festival happening every year between January and February.

                        There is no dearth of Buddhist temples in Myanmar so the other one is Htilominlo Temple which is situated in Bagan.It is 
                      believed that is one of the oldest temples in Myanmar and the construction of this one can be dated back to the reign of 
                      King-Htilominlo which was during 1211-1231.With a height of 46 meters in total,the temple is three storeys tall and is built 
                      mainly with red brick.It was constructed in the 1218 era under the rules of King-Htilominlo and is similar in structure to 
                      the Sulamani Temple,which was built almost three decades ago.Its Shikhara is quite similar to that of the Ananda Temple except 
                      that it is not glided.

                      <p>
                        Gawdawpalin Temple was built in 1175 by King Narapatisithu.Legend has it that the King has committed a terrible crime against 
                        his ancestors and as punishment went blind.Brahmen astrologers advised the King to make amends by making idols of his ancestors 
                        and placing them on thrones.The King worshiped these idols and begged for forgiveness.Miraculously he eventually regained his 
                        sight.The pagoda had other secrets besides healing powers;after the 1975 earthquake a secret passage was revealed.Mysterious!

                    <p>
                      You enter the red-brick Sulamani Temple through a gateway and it's like entering another world as you walk the pathway to the 
                      entrance.It's one of the most visited temples,so is another favorite of the hawkers.They'll quit pestering you for a dollar and 
                      in return give you a tour.The temple has frescoes,though all but the ones on the south have been badly damaged because of their 
                      exposure to the elements.Because of the vaulted openings,the light filtering in this temple is lovely.

                      <p>
                        Pyathatgyi Temple is a massive brick temple that was constructed during the 13th.A staircase leads you to the top terrace 
                        where you have great view of the plains of Bagan its temples and pagodas.An added touch,which made us feel like we were 
                        transported back in time,are the candles that line and light your way up the staircase.This temple is a popular place to 
                        watch the sun set on Bagan.To miss this temple would be a big mistake.

                      <p>
                        Again,we have never seen Gu Byauk Gyi Myin Kabar on a map of Bagan temples,it is a hidden gem which our local guide 
                        took us to.Built in 1113,it is located in Myinkaba Village and is unmissable for two reasons.The first is due to the 
                        interior which is adorned in the oldest,original paintings found in Bagan.These paintings are so precious,no photography 
                        is allowed inside nor any bright lighting.Instead you are guided round the temple by a guide who has an electric torch on 
                        a long cable which illuminates the famous frescoes without causing damage.

                    <h4>10.Manuha Temple</h4>
                    <p>
                      We are ending our temples in Bagan guide with the last temple,Manuha Temple.If you were impressed by the reclining Buddha 
                      in Shinbinthalyaung Temple(which was 70ft long)you will be amazed by what can be found at Manuha temple.Built in 1067,not 
                      only is Manuha temple home to 3 large Buddha images but one enormous(90ft) reclining Buddha.At the entrance a giant alms 
                      bowl can be found-so tall there is a ladder leading up to it.As we were visiting just days before Thingyan Festival,there 
                      were many locals donating offerings of rice,flowers and money.Once inside,you will wonder why the rooms surrounding the 
                      Buddha statues are so small.This is because the Buddhas(one of which is 46ft,the other two are 33ft high)were built first 
                      by King Manuha-hence the temple's name.Then the temple was built around them.King Manuha spent a large proportion of his 
                      life in captivity,therefore built the small rooms to represents his frustrations of being held captive.

                    <h4>11.Hot air balloon</h4>
                    <p>
                      Bagan's temples are best viewed from a high vantage-point,and there's no higher perspective than the one you'll get 
                      from a hot air balloon gliding 2,000 feet in the air.Unlike helicopter and ultralight flights,balloon flights are relatively 
                      silent and static,combining with the reddish angled light of the sunrise to create the best conditions for viewing Bagan's 
                      temple plain.With that in mind,consider signing up for an elegant balloon ride where you will soar into the sky and glide 
                      gracefully over the complex which offers you a completely different vantage point where you can look down on the glorious 
                      temples here.If you don't have a head for heights,then you may still want to watch the colorful balloons taking off and 
                      floating over Bagan as this is a sight in itself and makes a great photo opportunity.
